# Victoria Green — Single-page Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal single-page portfolio template populated with Victoria Green's name and bio. Replace placeholders with your real content, headshot, resume, and project links.

Files:
- `index.html` — single page layout (populated with your name & bio)
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small JS for nav + smooth scroll
- `Victoria-Green-Resume.pdf` — (optional) place your resume file here
- `victoria-headshot.jpg` — replace with your headshot image

Quick steps to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `victoria-portfolio`).
2. Push these files to the repo root (default branch `main`).
   - git init
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
   - git branch -M main
   - git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   - git push -u origin main
3. On GitHub, go to Settings → Pages (or Pages tab), set Source to `main` branch and `/ (root)`, then Save.
4. After a minute or two your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`
   - If you name the repo `<your-username>.github.io` it will be served at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

Notes
- Email used in the site: `toriagreen778@gmail.com`.
- LinkedIn: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriahgreen`.
- Place your resume file in the repo root named `Victoria-Green-Resume.pdf`, or change the filename in `index.html` if you prefer a different name.
